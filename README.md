# IOS Stack Machine ðŸ§ 
## Ever wondered if you can use Apple Notes to write code?
(probably not.)
Well, now you can!

IOS Stack Machine (ISM) is an interpreter implemented in Apple Shortcuts, thus it works in all Apple devices that have Shortcuts app installed.
### Hello World Program

After installing ISM to your device, go ahead and open Notes app and create a new note. Name the note however you like however, the name of your note should end with `.ism`, so that ISM can see your code.

To the next line, append this code.

```asm
println Hello world!
```
